# Welcome to Level 4 - Biotope Basic Component (Developer Turtle)

You have learned a lot of basics in our daily developer life so far. You should feel comfortable with JS, CSS and HTML and have some experience with NPM, Node and Gulp.  

You have heard about Biotope. Biotope is a Component Ecosystem we develop in the open here at VI. After that Level you should feel comfortable writing simple Components inside Biotope. Don't fear to ask, propose and make changes. 


## Guidelines

 1. A component always consists of CSS and HTMl (JS is optional)
 2. Each component lives in it's own folder
 3. HTML and CSS are located in `index.js`
 4. Styles are located in style.scss
 5. Each CSS Class starts with a unique component name
 6. The HTML of each component only uses it's own prefixed classes
 7. Components can use other components, but they never overwrite their styles
